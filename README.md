PicoCore-S3 is a small form factor System-on-Module (SOM) designed around the Espressif ESP32-S3-PICO-1 SiP. The SOM is breadboard-friendly and has castellated pads along its periphery. PicoCore-S3 contains enough hardware to hit the ground running, but it can also be mounted on various carrier boards for expanded functionality. All sensors on PicoCore-S3 are compatible with ESPHome and therefore Home Assistant.
